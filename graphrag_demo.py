# graphrag_demo.py: Basic GraphRAG Demo for EduGraph AI
# Uses OpenAI embeddings to create a sample knowledge graph from NCERT text.
# Requires: pip install openai langchain langchain-openai langchain-community faiss-cpu
# Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable: export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Sample NCERT Text (Physics example: Newton's Laws)
ncert_texts = [
    "Newton's First Law: An object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.",
    "Newton's Second Law: The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. F = ma.",
    "Newton's Third Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.",
    "Friction: Opposition to motion, e.g., in daily life like walking on Indian roads during monsoon."

# Set up QA chain (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

# In full app: Expand to Neo4j graph, add Whisper/DALLÂ·E integration.
